    House8L Dataset

    This dataset was constructed based on data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau's 1990 Summary Tape File 1 (STF 1).
    The data encompasses various demographic and housing statistics aggregated at the State-Place level across all U.S. states.
    Most of the raw counts were transformed into appropriate proportions to facilitate analysis. The dataset is part of a collection 
    designed to predict the median house price in a region based on its demographic composition and housing market characteristics.
